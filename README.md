## My dotfiles!

These are the configuration files I use every day.
This configuration provides something clean and comfortable for everyday use without causing any issues.

### Install

To use all of this, you need Linux (in my case, Debian)
and install these things:

**kitty**: terminal for dev's.
**alacritty**: modern terminal emulator.
**rofi**: popup window switcher.
**i3**: window manager.
**picom**: compositor
**polybar**: status bar.
**fish**: a smart and user-friendly command line shell.
**i3status/i3blocks**: status bar alternative (for i3)

And that's it! Copy all the files to the ".config"
